Why does a Monday come after Sunday?
Have you ever wondered why days of the week follow a specific order?

I am a person who constantly finds hidden patterns in everything I see. I was not always like this, but when things start going wrong (me being me) will not try to figure out why they went wrong, instead try to offload the burden of doing something wrong into factors that we cannot control. To make it clear let me give an example, if I lose a game that I am playing I say, wind has a role to play in my defeat, rather than my poor skills of the game. Similarly, if I don't score well, I say it's not my lucky day. Whenever I get good news in a particular dress, I wear the same exact dress for all important things in my life.

 In the same manner I realized I feel low on Saturdays, and this is usually caused by external factors. I made a log of every time I felt sad and found that it was Saturday.
While everybody enjoys their weekend waiting for a Saturday, I would like to maintain a lowkey. But it got me thinking, why are names of the weeks named in a certain order??

In India the names of the week directly translate to planets of solar system, as opposed to English which derives the names of the week from a different language.

But bottom line in every language:
- SUNday is the day of Sun
- MONday is the day of Moon
- TUESday is the day of Mars
- WEDNESday is the day of Mercury
- THURSday is the day of Jupiter
- FRIday is the day of Venus
- SATURday is the day of Saturn.

My next question was, why are there only seven days in a week and not more or less? We all know there are 365 days in a year because Earth takes approximately 365 days to go around Sun and takes 24 hours to finish a rotation causing a day to have 24 hours. But why does a week have 7 days?

This page claims that lunar cycle is approximately rounded to 28 days (a month), which is further divided to 4 sets. But you see there is no consistency here, we cannot say first day of second week of every month is a full moon day or every week of every month starts with a new moon day, things have gone off hands!!

Anyways circling back to why the days follow the order they follow; I came across this post in a stack exchange 
The second answer made a lot of sense to me, which I will write below, which further explained the first answer and the previous link to me.

" The naming probably originated from Hellenistic astrology in Egypt, wherein each day would be associated with the influence of a particular celestial object. The origins are lost, but the writings of Roman historian Dion Cassius (AD 150-235) have survived; he describes the scheme as follows:

The celestial objects were ordered according to their orbital period:

Saturn 29 years
Jupiter 12 years
Mars 687 days
Sun 365 days 
Venus 224 days
Mercury 88 days
Moon 29 days
Now assign the first hour of the first day to Saturn, the second to Jupiter, etc, and repeat the cycle. The 24th hour is then assigned to Mars, the 1st hour of the second day to the Sun, and so forth. The first hour of the 8th day will correspond with Saturn again, and the whole cycle is complete. Each day would then be named after the celestial object assigned to the first hour (which corresponds with 6 a.m.). In this way, we get the correct order

Saturn, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus."

Now the planetary hours in this will make more sense! (Notice the time difference)
